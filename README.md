# Izza 

## Presentation : 

Izza is my personal data science and machine learning toolbox. It is written in Python 3 and stands on the shoulders of giants (mainly pandas and scikit-learn). It loosely follows scikit-learn's fit/transform/predict convention.

Some clustering methods are implemented : 

- [x] clusterbagging 
- [ ] clusterisolation

There is also some personnal function : 

- [x] precision 
- [x] recall 

## Installation (not yet on Pypi): 

```shell
    pip install izza
```
